# Bio Service

This service provides a `/bio` endpoint for fetching Telegram user bios using Telethon and session files.

## Setup

1. Place your Telegram session file in the `sessions/` directory:
   ```
   sessions/12262333496.session
   ```

2. Ensure the corresponding JSON credentials file is also present:
   ```
   sessions/12262333496.json
   ```

3. Deploy on Railway â€” it will use `${PORT}` automatically.
